Good Evening Sir!
I am Divyanshu Batta Class:VIII-BOLD
I have coded the Students GPS Gobindgarh app.
I have made it for replacing the school app.
I have also hosted the app. 
Link:https://divyanshubatta.github.io

Some Features:
    1. It is 100% Responsive for every single device.
    2. There is a login Page system in which once all the asked credentials given, you do not have to reenter the credentials . You will always be redirected to the Home Page only. It will act as a Login Page System.
    3. There is also a Log Out button using which you can log out and reenter the new credentials.

Sir, If you have any suggestions, you can message me.
Hope you Like it!
Thanks!
